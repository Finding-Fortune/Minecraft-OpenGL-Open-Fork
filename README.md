## This repository holds a fork of my minecraft openGL clone!
This repository will also be used for tutorial videos - feel free to also take a fork of this repository and do with it as you like (including making your own game engine fork!), although please credit me if you do - as the repository is under the MIT X license!

#### Building Note 
Note this repository is defacto built using VSCode's c++ tools - so it uses the tasks.json file in the .vscode folder. By default the tasks.json there is for windows using clang++, but there is also a version for MacOS in the misc folder.

#### Shortcut commands for building in vscode: 
- command+shift+b to build c++ code
- type ./app in terminal to run the compiled code
